# Custom Keyboard

A sandwich case built from 1.5mm and 3mm acrylic sheets.
The case was fabricated with swill, but an additional switchplate was introduced, essentially making the switchplate a fat plate style, giving it a really good rigidity and sound.

This keyboard is built with:

Switches: Gateron Baby Kangaroo V2
Stablizers: Durock v2


Keycaps: Maxkey Foundation
